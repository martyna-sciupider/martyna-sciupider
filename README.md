# Hello World
I invite you to familiarize yourself with my CV written in HTML language 
https://martyna-sciupider-cv.netlify.app/

I'm a dynamic and meticulous individual who is ready to take on the
next challenge in my career. I have experience working on
largescale projects such as Expressway S19 and Highway A2. I am
not afraid of challenges and always strive to learn quickly in order to
effectively navigate new situations. My determination and diligent
approach to achieving goals enable me to successfully accomplish
tasks. I am prepared for new challenges and confident that I can
make a positive contribution to the next project.
After testing a program needed in the current industry, I became
more interested in the subject of testing. Therefore, I upgraded my
qualifications with knowledge of ISTQB Foundation Level confirmed
by a certificate. I continued my education by completing Postman
and PostrgeSQL training courses obtaining certificates.
